Last year, I had the privilege of working on a Figma design that aims to help monitor and support children with autism. ðŸ§©
ðŸ“± This app design connects seamlessly to smartwatches worn by autism children, enabling caregivers and parents to stay informed and offer timely assistance when needed.
Key Features:
âœ… Real-time Monitoring: Keep track of vital signs and location data.
âœ… Customized Alerts: Receive alerts for unusual behaviour or unusual situations.
âœ… Interactive Interface: Designed with intuitive and sensory-friendly elements.
âœ… Data Visualization: Gain insights through user-friendly charts and analytics.
As an advocate for inclusive technology, I believe that harnessing the power of design and technology can make a meaningful impact on the lives of those we care about. ðŸ’™
